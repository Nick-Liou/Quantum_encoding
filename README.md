# Quantum_encoding
Comparative Study and Analysis of Classical-to-Quantum Data Encoding through Embedding and Mapping Techniques
<!-- Comparative Analysis of Classical-to-Quantum Mapping Techniques in Data Encoding -->

Techniques implemented:
- Qubit Lattice
- Basis Encoding: Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR)
- Amplitude Encoding: Quantum Probability Image Encoding (QPIE) 
- Angle Encoding: Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI)

Techniques to be implemented:
- Quantum Associative Memory
- Displacement Encoding
- IQP Encoding
- QAOA Encoding
- Squeezing Encoding
- Hybrid Encodings


## Installation

You can install the required dependencies using pip. First, navigate to the root directory of the project and then run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.


In the '====.py' you can choose the encoding technique you want from the implemented ones, adjust optional arguments in the dictionary and provide your data.
